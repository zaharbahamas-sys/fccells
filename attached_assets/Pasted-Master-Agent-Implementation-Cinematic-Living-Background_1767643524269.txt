Master Agent Implementation: Cinematic Living Background & Login UI
1. Core Asset & Scene Setup:

Base Layer (Static): Use the provided high-resolution image (Nile, Pyramids, Jebel Barkal, Towers, Login Box) as the main background for the landing page body. Ensure the central Login Card remains opaque and fully functional.

2. Dynamic Animation Layers (The Living Scene):

Layer A: The Flowing Nile (Realistic Water FX)

Technique: Implement a WebGL or CSS Canvas ripple effect specifically on the water area of the image.

Motion: Create a continuous, smooth, lateral flow animation (flow speed: slow).

Detail: Add dynamic reflections. The sun's light path on the water should shimmer with the ripples, creating a "liquid light" effect that feels wet and alive.

Layer B: The Dynamic Sun (Atmospheric Glow)

Technique: Add a soft, pulsing CSS radial gradient glow around the sun disc.

Motion: The sun itself should have a very subtle, slow upward drift (as if rising further).

Atmosphere: The golden-orange light cast on the pyramids and landscape should gently pulse in sync with the sun, making the entire scene "breathe" with light.

Layer C: Drifting Clouds (Parallax Sky)

Technique: Overlay a transparent layer of high-quality cloud wisps (.png assets) in the sky area.

Motion: Animate them moving slowly and smoothly across the horizon (e.g., from right to left). Use a parallax effect so distant clouds move slower than closer ones, adding depth.

Layer D: Growing Greenery (The Eco-Effect)

Technique: Create multiple overlay masks for the green areas (bushes, palm trees) on the riverbanks.

Motion: Implement a slow, continuous fade-in and scale-up animation on these masks. The vegetation should appear to be gradually becoming denser, greener, and more lush over a period of 30-60 seconds, symbolizing growth and life.

3. User Interaction (Subtle Response):

Mouse Movement: Add a very subtle parallax shift to the entire scene (Pyramids, Barkal, Towers) based on cursor movement, giving a sense of 3D depth behind the Login Card.

4. Final Polish:

Ensure all animations are smooth, optimized for performance, and run in a continuous, non-distracting loop behind the login form, creating a premium, cinematic "Living Picture" feel.
